# Thesis Title: Spatio Temporal Crime Hotspot Detection and Prediction in Urban North West England

Portfolio of Python code I applied in my MSc Final Project for exploratory data analysis, forecasting, clustering and ensemble methods. 

#1 includes some beautiful Folium package mapping. Do check back as more code will be uploaded weekly as I aim to present the analysis process and methods in the clearest possible manner.

An overview of the model development:

**Abstract**:
Historically rising urbanisation is significantly altering the economic and social dynamics in cities, impacting the quality of human life. This notable growth in the urban population is posing challenges related to city management, services, and safety. In urban areas like Merseyside and Liverpool with higher crime rates, ensuring public safety and security is increasingly complex and challenging. This paper aims to empower British police forces, presenting novel approaches for authorities to better visualise, identify and predict crime hotspots. First, Feature Engineering and Double Exponential Smoothing (DES) investigates crime predictor variables. Second, Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) detects the hotspots with higher risks of crime events. Finally an ensemble model of HDBSCAN and DES is exploited to predict the frequency of offences in each dense crime region.
